# Work Day Scheduler Homework Assignment 5:

Tasked with making a day planner for normal business hours.

The planner shows the current date at the top of the page and a textarea for every hour where tasks can be saved.

Hours in the past are colored gray, the present hour is red, and future hours are green.

Clicking the save button will store the user's submission into the browser's localStorage so that saved tasks will display even after the page is reloaded.

Other Libraries Used: Moment.js, jQuery, Bootstrap.
